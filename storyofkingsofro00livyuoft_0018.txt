xiv Introduction

Roman story are neither historical, nor yet coeval
with the subjects which they celebrate, still their
fame is so great and their beauty and interest so
surpassingâ€š that it would be unpardonable to
sacrifice them altogether to the spirit of enquiry,
and to exclude them from the place which they
have so long held in Roman history?
