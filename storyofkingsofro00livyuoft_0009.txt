PRE FAOE.

THESE stories from the First Book of Livy have

been considerably simplifiedâ€š especially in the
earlier chapterS. In the latter part of the book,
where fewer alterations have been made, the
beauty and vigour of Livy's style have not, I
trust, been altogether spoilt by my editing. My
text, though simple and straightforward, will be
found to contain a large amount of useful Latin

idiom.
