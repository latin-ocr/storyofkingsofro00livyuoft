xii Introduction

mists of antiquity. VVritten documents, the only
safe shrine of history, were then meagre and few
in number. The· registers of the priestS, together
with other official and private records, almost all
perished in the conflagration of the city.' Livy is
referring to the buming of Rome by the Gauls
in 390 B.c. The almost total destruction of
documents and monuments of all kinds at this
disastrous time is a fact of the first importance,
when we are considering the trustworthiness of the

story of the kings. The earliest historiari of
Rome was Quintus Fabius Pictor, whose work

does not survive. He wrote more than 500 years
after the foundation of the city; and he can have
had at his disposal only a small number of docu-
ments and inscriptions, which had escaped the
general havoc. Hence we may at once infer that
the bulk of the history of the kings can have no
better origin than transmission from mouth to
mouth. Now, in Livy's record there are many
scenes described with great minuteness. For
example, the animated description of the combat
between Horatii and Curiatii (ch. 9 of this book)
is remarkable for its full details It is impossible
to believe that minute particulars like these could
be passed on by ora] tradition through several

centuries. Such detailed descriptions must surely
be due to the creative fancy of poet or novelist.

There are several striking examples of appar-
ently pure fiction in the stories of the later kings,
