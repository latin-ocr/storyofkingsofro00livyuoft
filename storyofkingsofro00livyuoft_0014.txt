on the other side of the Tiber; and the books of

It will be seen at a glauce that a great part of
this narrative cannot be considered historica13 it
is mythology pure and simple. Some Roman
writers attempted to frame a true history out of
the supernatura] element in these early stories.
To take one example out of many,—wishing to
reduce the beautiful legend of the T ranslation of
Romulus to a probable history, they explained
the disappearance of the king by alleging that he
was torn limb from limb by the angry senatorS‚
who carried away the pieces under their gownS.
Such a method is, of course, hopeless. We cannot
extract a true history out of materials which are
for the most part fabulous. We must content
ourselves with the belief that these legends merely
fill up the void left by a lost history. In
dealing with them, ⁶ we are‚' as has been well said,
‘ in a manner upon enchanted ground. Although
some real elements exist, yet the general picture
before us is a mere fantasy. Men love to complete
what is imperfect and to realise what is imaginary.'

By the side of the pure mythology in the
Numa legend we find another ele111e11t‚—that which
has to do with the origin of institutions. Pride
in their national customs was a leading feature
in the Roman character. The people loved to
have for them the sanction of divine authority.
