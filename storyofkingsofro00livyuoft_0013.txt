‘ Though Numa took so much care for the
service of the gods, yet he forbade all costly
sacrifices ς. neither did he suffer blood to be shed
011 the altars, nor any images of the gods to be
made. But he taught the people to offer in
sacrifice nothing but the fruits of the earth, meal,
and cakes of flour, and roasted corn. For he
loved husbandry, and he wished his people to live
every man on his own inheritance in peace and in
happiness, So the lands, which Romulus had won
in war, he divided out amongst the people, and
gave a certain portion to every man. He then
ordered landmarks to be set on every portion;
and Terminus the god of landmarks had them in
his keeping, and he who moved a landmark was
accursed. The craftsmen of the city, who had no
land, were divided according to their callings ς and
there were made of them nine guilds. So all was
peaceful and prosperous throughout the reign of
Numa. The gates of the temple of Janus were
never opened 3 for the Romans had no wars and no
enemies. And Numa built a temple to Faith‚ and
appointed a solemn worship for her, that men
might learn not to lie or deceive, but to speak and
act in honesty. And when he had lived to the
age of fourscore yearS‚ he died at last by a gentle
decay3 and he was buried under the hill Janiculum
