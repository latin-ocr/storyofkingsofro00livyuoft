28 The Story of tlte Kz'ngs·

CHAPTER 2.

6. conditam, ‘the city when it has been built,’ 391.

8. augurio, ablative of manner.

9. templa, ‘circuits‚' ⁴ districts! The literal meaning of
templum is a ‘ space marked off,’ πλε. by the augur’s staff, for
the purpose of taking omens. Hence it means ‘ sacred enclosure, ’
and then ‘temple.’

Palatium—Aventinum, ‘ the Palatine—the Aventine,’ two
of the seven hills on which Rome stood, when complete. See
Plan of Rome.

11. hoc nuntiato. See 237. ’

12. utrumque—salutaverunt, ⁴ each of them was hailed
as king by his nomades: If we translate thus, we can see
why sui is used.

13. tempore, ‘ by priority in time,’ ablative of cause.

1111, the supporters of Remus3 m, of Romulus.

16. ludibrio, ‘in mookery,’ ablative of manner.

fratris, objective genitive, 262 (a).

18. pereat, subjunctive expressing a wish, 359.

20. imperio. See 242.

conditoris nomine. Livy’s etymology is at fault. Roma
cannot be derived from Romulus. It probably means ‘ River-
town‚’ its situation in this respect being unique among the
early towns of Latium. Some were clustered on and round
the Alban hills; others lined the sea-coast.

CHAP TER 3.

1. Palatium primum. The first Roman settlement on the
Palatine was sometimes called Roma quadrata, ‘ square Rome,’
from the quadrilateral shape of the hill.

3. Geryone interempto. Geryon, a monster with three
bodies and powerful wings, lived in Erytheia, a fabulous island
in the western Mediterranean. The slaying of Geryon and the
capture of his famous oxen formed one of the twelve labours of
Hercules, who, on his return, passed through Gaul and Italy.

4. mira specie, ablative of quality, 234.
